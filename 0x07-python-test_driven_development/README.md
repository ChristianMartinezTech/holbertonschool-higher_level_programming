# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
# Learning Objectives

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What’s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases

# Requirements
## Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: ***vi, vim, emacs***
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using * python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ***#!/usr/bin/python3***
* A ***README.md*** file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ***wc***

## Python Test Cases

* Allowed editors: ***vi, vim, emacs***
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder ***tests***
* All your test files should be text files (extension: ***.txt***)
* All your ***modules*** should have a documentation
* All your ***classes*** should have a documentation
* All your ***functions*** (inside and outside a class) should have a documentatio
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
